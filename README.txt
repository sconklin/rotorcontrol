Computer interface for a ham radio antenna rotator

In progress - NOT A FUNCTIONAL DEVICE YET

These files are for a personal project - a computer interface for an amateur radio antenna rotator.

This is the in-progress work for a controller based on the Arduino. The code is under development and probably broken. Nevertheless, if anything in here is useful for you, you're welcome to it.

Active development is taking place in the files under sketch/
